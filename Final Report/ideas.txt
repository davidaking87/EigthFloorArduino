@ point to restart!
PCDuino okay...
	(I2C SOLID wire Julio put in)
but need more INFO to work with!
	=> more time for IMU, at LEAST 2 more lasers (side)
		wheel encoders to correct rotation, etc
motor shield INCORRECT! => get new shield

not enough room to test? need more maps?
more types of tools! ex: wood / drills... stuff to manufacture mounts, walls, etc
