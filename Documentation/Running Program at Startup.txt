how to set program?
1. Turn on PCDuino & run program via Arduino IDE.
2. Stop program by closing the terminal window.
3. Find where the compiled program is.
	a) Run: sudo find / -name <sketch name here>.*
	or b) Go to /tmp/build<long number here>.tmp
			Note: This folder seems to be deleted when PCDuino isn't plugged into power anymore.
				(If it's just turned off, it can keep files for a reboot)
4. In this folder, run ls
5. The different-colored file = executable.
6. Copy this file to a permenant directory.
	Now, you can run this whenever you want!

To run at startup (if sd card is plugged in)...
7. Open /home/ubuntu/autoRun.sh
8. Find the if-block.
9. Inside the if-block, call the program you just copied.
	Note: You MUST use absolute filepaths.
	ex: /home/ubuntu/mainDrive.o

--------------------------

so.. how to run program @ startup?
1. Turn on the PCDuino & plug in the SD card.
		The PCDuino should find the SD card.
2. Turn off the PCDuino.
3. The next time you reboot the PCDuino, it should run the program.
	To check: The motor shield's lights will turn on...
		But the screen will stay black.
	b) If the program doesn't start (& PCDuino goes to the desktop),
		you probably plugged in the SD card while the PCDuino was off.
			Repeat step 2, and it should detect the SD card at the next bootup.
4. To go back to the desktop, press Ctrl + C

Note: After bootup, it will always create a log file @ /home/ubuntu/startupLog.txt

To stop the program from running @ bootup:
1. While the PCDuino is on, eject the SD card.
2. Then unplug the SD card.
		You should be all set.
WARNING: If you unplug the SD card while the PCDuino is turned off,
	it might run the program one more time @ startup.
